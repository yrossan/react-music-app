# Intro to React Exercises

Practice of the basics of React, including using functional components, eventing and state 

## Brief

#### Music App: 

Create a React website that showcases your favourite artists songs/albums.

Requirements are:

 - Setup your first React App using npm and vite. x
 - Install the required libraries x
 - Using JSX, make your website a portfolio of their work.
 - The site should be broken down into components that are rendered on the same page.
 - It should contain at the very minimum two components. An example would be:
    - Their name, music type and an introduction paragraph.
    - A list of their songs/albums including name,release date and cover art.
 - Add a 'Like' feature to your music page
   - Add an element eg. a button, or an icon next to each song
   - When a user clicks the element, change something about it to indicate the user has 'liked' the song
   - When a user clicks again, the element should revert back to the 'unliked' view
   - Use state to track if a track has been liked or not
   - You may create additional components to acheive this as you see fit

- Add a controlled form
  - Create a controlled form into which users can provide data
  - On submission, do something with this data 

**NB: Do not consume any APIs to get the data on your chosen artist - hard code for now!**

## Bonus
- Have a go at [styling your app](https://react.dev/learn#adding-styles)
